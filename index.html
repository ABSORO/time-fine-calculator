            <h2>Important Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="info-item">HUT = Hold Until Trial, this means that a Judge shall sentence or give them a trial depending on the individual's entered plea.</li>
                <li class="info-item">If a trial is required, open an LFM ticket.</li>
                <li class="info-item">When Judges are in town, a person may plea to all charges listed and the Judge will handle all sentencing or fine assignment related to any case.</li>
                <li class="info-item">Judges may deviate from sentences listed here but MUST respect the drive for story and must never CK or sentence to life without explicit Admin approval or consent from the opposing players.</li>
                <li class="info-item">While lawmen should feel comfortable charging criminals with the listed times and fines, they are also encouraged to lower them if the circumstances call for it. Use your judgement and help foster good storytelling so that both sides enjoy the encounters.</li>
                <li class="info-item">If caught blatantly committing a crime, not guilty verdicts will not be entertained.</li>
                <li class="info-item">Persons may plea Not Guilty to 1st Degree Felonies or Higher as well as any individual charges with a stated time of 1 Year or Higher. Anything else shall be appeal after the fact or handled by a Judge on scene.</li>

            <h2>How Sentencing Time is Calculated</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Charges Listed in Days:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Total days are summed.</li>
                        <li>If total days are less than 401, the sentencing time remains in days.</li>
                        <li>If total days are 401 or more, the sentencing time is converted to years:
                            <ul>
                                <li>401 - 500 Days: 1 Year</li>
                                <li>501 - 600 Days: 2 Years</li>
                                <li>And so on, incrementing by 1 year for each additional 100 days.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Charges with Fixed Sentencing in Years:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed years are added directly to the total years.</li>
                        <li>Not converted into days.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Charges listed as years in the penal code are treated as 1440 days (24h) each. Charges not listed as years are added up using the conversion method described above.</p>
